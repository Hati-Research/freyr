# MicroROS with embedded Rust

The Freyr project currently contains a proof of concept of MicroROS bindings for
use with Rust.
You can find the PoC [here](https://github.com/Hati-Research/freyr/tree/main/microros-rs).
The PoC currently only supports RP2040 and has many shortcomings documented in
its README.
